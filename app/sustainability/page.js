            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Sustainability Programs</h2>
          <p>INEL's commitment to sustainability is woven into our core operations, focusing on comprehensive environmental stewardship and impactful social initiatives</p>
          <ul className="space-y-4 list-disc list-inside">
          <b>Environmental Stewardship:</b> We are actively reducing our ecological footprint through various initiatives across our manufacturing processes.
            <li>Climate Action & Energy Efficiency: We are dedicated to lowering our carbon footprint by integrating eco-friendly technologies and optimizing energy consumption [Previous turn, 20]. This includes the installation of LED lighting systems across our factories, establishing Solar PV power plants at all our facilities, and procuring renewable wind power through strategic Power Purchase Agreements [Previous turn, 287]. In FY 2023-24, 14,183 GJ of our total energy consumption of 37,148 GJ came from renewable sources [Previous turn]. Our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for FY 2023-24 were 1,828 and 1,894 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent, respectively [Previous turn]. We have also introduced measures like a 150-TR air-cooled HVAC system with VFD controls for SMT clean room operations and reduced potting machine booster pump capacity to save energy.
            </li>
            <li> Water Conservation: Recognizing the critical role of water, all our plants adhere to zero liquid discharge norms [Previous turn, 283]. This is achieved through the installation of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) at all facilities and an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) at our Hosur factory, treating and reusing polluted water [Previous turn, 283, 304]. Our average water consumption in FY 2023-24 was 142 KL/day [Previous turn].</li>
            <li> Waste Management & Circularity: We are committed to responsible waste management, actively promoting waste recycling and working towards a circular economy model to reduce waste production and landfill volumes [Previous turn, 36]. We diligently monitor hazardous chemical consumption and have successfully reduced average hazardous waste generated across our Hosur, Puducherry, and Rewari plants from FY 2022-23 to FY 2023-24. In FY 2023-24, our total waste generated was 542.14 metric tonnes, with 515.05 metric tonnes recovered through recycling. We have also implemented strategies to reduce hazardous chemical usage, such as replacing mineral oil-based coolants with biodegradable synthetic ones and introducing automatic chemical blending machines.
            </li>
            <li> Biodiversity & Green Initiatives: We support reforestation programs and have developed a "Kurungadukal" (Mini Forest) at our Hosur factory premises in 2022, in collaboration with the Government of Tamil Nadu [Previous turn, 270]. We also encourage employees and stakeholders to participate in community-based environmental projects.</li>
            <li>Sustainable Products & Processes: Our engineering and manufacturing processes incorporate sustainable practices, such as the introduction of Lead-Free Soldering Wire in over 85% of our soldering area to improve employee health and prevent environmental pollution. We also use Electro Static Filters and Fume Killers in our soldering processes to reduce fumes by 95%. </li>
            <li>Sustainable Sourcing: We have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing, with 75% of our inputs sourced sustainably in FY 2023-24. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul className="space-y-4 list-disc list-inside">
            <b>Social Impact & People-Centric Growth:</b>  Our employees are the cornerstone of our success, and we prioritize their well-being and development, alongside fostering strong community ties..
            <li>Employee Well-being & Development: We provide comprehensive training programs to enhance both technical expertise and personal development, ensuring our workforce stays at the forefront of technological advancements [Previous turn, 40]. All permanent and other-than-permanent employees are covered by health and accident insurance, and all female employees receive maternity benefits and access to day-care facilities [Previous turn, 254]. We ensure all new joinees receive health and safety training and conduct regular emergency mock drills every six months [Previous turn, 258]. Annually, 100% of our permanent employees undergo performance and career development reviews [Previous turn, 259]. We are proud to be certified as a 'Great Place to Work' for the 4th time in a row.</li>
            <li>Community Engagement & CSR: Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives focus on empowering local communities near our operations. In FY 2023-24, we made a significant CSR contribution of â‚¹95.96 Lakhs [Previous turn, 45, 225]. Our programs address hunger, poverty, rural development, education, vocational skills, gender equality, healthcare, and sanitation [Previous turn, 113]. Notable achievements include the construction of a Community Hall for vulnerable groups in Sarandapalli village, Hosur, supporting children's education and self-help groups, and the installation of sanitary napkin incinerators in schools [Previous turn, 42, 44, 270]. We also equipped a Government Primary Health Center with RO water purification systems and advanced laboratory equipment.</li>
            <li>Human Rights & Inclusivity: We are committed to respecting and promoting human rights [Previous turn]. Our Business Head and HR Head are responsible for addressing human rights impacts and issues [Previous turn, 272]. In FY 2023-24, human rights training was provided to 21.892% of employees and 87.044% of workers [Previous turn, 271]. Our POSH policy protects complainants in sexual harassment cases, with two complaints resolved in FY 2023-24. We are also actively working to make our facilities accessible to differently abled visitors, with one facility already compliant with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and plans to extend these facilities to other units [Previous turn, 257, 276]. Human rights requirements are part of our business agreements and contracts.</li>
